# Invoice Eth Utils API

This is the eth-utils-api service for the [Invoice Indie](https://invoice.indiealistic.studio) app. It is a very simple express.js app that decodes smartcontract data.

To setup the Invoice app locally please follow the instructions in the [invoice-dev](https://github.com/indiealistic/invoice-dev) repo.
